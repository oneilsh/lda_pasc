-- here we define concepts to filter out
-- variations of Findings of Sexual Activity (used by one only data partner that still passes QC)
-- COVID-19 itself (this has a large effect, when present it acts like an attractor, collapsing various COVID-related subtopic)
-- boring concepts (clinical finding etc.)
-- anything in the OMOP Concept table that isnt in the "condition" domain 
--  (some OMOP sites apparently add non-condition concepts into here erroneously)
