--* INPUT_persons_datapartners_concepts:
--*   desc: Defines the input data for training the model; identifying a hold_count column
--*     (for entries to be ignored during training). Results in training and validation
--*     but no test data.
--*   ext: sql
--*   inputs:
--*   - person_all_facts
--*   - condition_era_full_clean
--* 

-- first up: let's gather all of the different condition_concept_ids for each person into a single Array column... even though the function for it is called collect_list()
-- notice the column type Array in the output preview
-- we also define a subset to be labeled as hold-out;
-- non-hold-out rows are used for model training
-- hold-out rows are used for evaluation with coherence,
-- both types are used for data visualizations (except coherence)

SELECT /*+ COALESCE(14) */
       condition_era_full_clean.person_id as person_id, 
       condition_era_full_clean.data_partner_id as data_partner_id, 
       string(condition_era_full_clean.condition_concept_id) as concept_id,
       Person_all_facts.set = 'validate' as hold_out
FROM condition_era_full_clean
INNER JOIN Person_all_facts ON Person_all_facts.person_id = condition_era_full_clean.person_id
-- note: even though this is going to the model building, downstream code uses the 
-- hold_out column defined above to split into train/validate sets
WHERE Person_all_facts.set = 'train' OR Person_all_facts.set = 'validate'
-- GROUP BY person_id, data_partner_id
