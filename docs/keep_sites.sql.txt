-- I was quite tired of not having named branches for release versions for OMOP tables - so I was using
-- the sites_whitelist (master) and filtering the original LDS data based on the kept data partners
-- now though we DO have named branches for OMOP tables, but not for the sites whitelist!
-- so to generate the list of sites whitelisted by the release versions (and not change up the code here)
-- I will just use the Release Version Person table and select the distinct data partners kept in it

-- pinning to master for concept_set_members, since it's only added to
-- just to keep all inputs flowing through this workbook

-- concept is on a pinned branch tho

SELECT 
    DISTINCT data_partner_id
FROM Release_Version_Person
