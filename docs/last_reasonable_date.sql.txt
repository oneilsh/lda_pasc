-- this computes a "last reasonable date" for a given data partner, with some logic for weird cases
-- for most data partners it is the last_run_date
-- for those who don't list a last_run_date, we generously use the latest ran_run_date across all data partners
-- for those who date shift, we extract the potential shift number of days with some regex (first set of consecutive digits),
--   and use their last_run_date plus this potential shift date, ensuring it is after the last potentially-maximally-shifted date
