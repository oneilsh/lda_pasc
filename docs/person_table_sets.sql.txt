-- Selects a pseudo-random sample of person_ids, by hashing
-- the person_id an and keeping the given percent, 
-- keeping the given percent is done by taking the hash 
-- taking the hash modulo 100 (with a concatenated 
-- seed to get a different psuedo-random set), and then 
-- keeping the ones with modulo less than the percent value.

-- great thing is that the process is deterministic
-- by person_id: the same set of person ids will be kept 
-- given the same seed, so this can be re-used across
-- datasets to keep the same random subset of patients.
